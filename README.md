# Course Description
Advanced issues and application of technology in art. Application of interactive technology in installation and performance. Emphasis on collaborative projects. Course is repeatable up to 6 units. Prerequisite: Art 74 & 75 or permission of instructor. Misc/Lab: Lab 6 hours. Misc/Lab: Activity 6 hours.

This upper level studio course will facilitate sustained investigations into designed interactivity in real space. Students will create interactive installations, web or public interventions, and critical design objects using sensors or other computational devices. This course will be project driven; students will develop a project plan that includes the development of four distinct but related pieces which will begin with a written proposal and plan. After the proposal, students will have a chance to meet one-on-one with the instructor to design a production schedule that will identify necessary skill sets and components for production, track deliverables, and document their progress. The first two weeks of the course will prepare students for their first project proposal. In-class workshops will provide students with foundational technical skills necessary to develop interactive art projects. The instructor will provide introductory resources for specialized projects but most of the projects will necessitate independent research and students will spend the majority of their project production time out of class. In addition to independent production time, students can expect to spend roughly 1.5 hours per meeting outside of class on readings and tutorials.

**Course Goals**<br>
This course will provide a framework for experimenting with digital media art techniques and applications in order to develop a cohesive body of work. Critical and theoretical perspectives will be stressed. Projects will be presented in class, at a final show, and documented on student portfolio websites.<br>
**Students in this course will:**<br>
--> Create 3 main original art projects exploring the visual and conceptual language of New Media Art.<br>
--> Participate in 3 critiques in order to both receive peer feedback and also develop their own articulation skills in relationship to critical observation and thinking. <br>
--> Collaborate on a final gallery show of class work.<br>
--> Complete collaborative in-class exercises and responses to readings.<br>
--> Add to and develop their portfolio website that includes artist statements and documentation of work completed in class.<br>
--> Present a final artist talk that articulates their research and artistic process through documentation of their work, both in progress and final pieces. <br>


# Course Expectations
**Attendance and Behavior**<br>
Show up to class, and show up on time. Students are expected to be present and conduct themselves professionally. Attendance and participation are crucial to your success in this course. If you need to miss a class ahead of time, please let me know as soon as possible- in person and via email- as well as what you plan to do to make up the missed work and when you will turn it in. Please find two classmates who will be your support system (and vice versa) for the class and can fill you in if you need to miss class and/or troubleshoot with you when you are stuck.<br>

This is a hands on course, and an openness and willingness to learn is key. Itâ€™s not a software training course, but you will be given introductions to several applications and techniques. Learning these programs can be challenging so it is important to have a flexible attitude and to remain open to new things to achieve your goals. Creating digital media art (or any kind of art) can often be a non-linear, multi-platform, exploratory, and both individual and shared experience. Use your patience, curiosity, intellectual interests, honest experience, and what engages you most, to guide you. <br>

**Respectful Behavior & Technology Policy**<br>
Respect is an essential part of the class community. During lectures, group discussions, critiques, and during lab time, students are expected to be respectful. This includes not using their phones, taking naps, or talking to others outside of class context. Answering your phone, texting, and web browsing during lectures, critiques, discussions, or demos is unacceptable. You are welcome to use your electronic devices for class purposes. Students who cannot honor these requirements will be asked to leave. In the case that phone use becomes prevalent and disruptive, we will experiment with a phone stack. <br>

**Communication**<br>
Communication is an important part of this class. Be honest and clear about your work, about where you are in your work, about challenges you are experiencing. Please bring up issues before they become larger. I am available outside of class at office hours or by appointment.

**Readings, Discussions**<br>
There will be short reading assignments related to the course content. We will have some class and Canvas discussions about the material. Simply reading the material is not enough, it is expected that you to communicate your thoughts in class and Canvas submissions.<br>
<br>
**Participate**<br>
We value your skills, experience, and interests. Your views are important and we want to hear them. Involvement in the readings, discussions, and critiques are part of your participation grade and critical for each student and the class to thrive.

**Field Trips & Guest Speakers**<br>
We may be going offsite as a class at least once, and attending this field trip is a part of your participation grade. In addition, we may have guest speakers. Showing attention and respect is also a part of your grade.

**Computer Use**<br>
A computer is mandatory to make work for this class. If you do not have a computer or the software outlined earlier in this syllabus, you have access to the CADRE computer labs and the University computers to complete your work.
