# Software and Program Checklist for Art 107
Here is a list of programs that we will be using. You will either download these directly, or sign up for a free account.

**Equipment Checklist**
**Notebook/Sketchbook**: Students are required to have a notebook or sketchbook for class. This will be used for taking notes during lectures and sketching or outlining ideas for assignments. This is for your benefit. [Studies show that note taking by hand has been proven to help your brain work better and retain more information](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away). 

**Computer Access**: Students are encouraged to have a laptop for this course that meets system requirements for operating [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html). If no laptop is available, students may use the lab computers. Please see me with questions.  

**External or Cloud Storage (Thumb Drive or Hard Drive)**: It is important to back up your work! It’s a terrible experience to lose something that you have worked hard on because your computer unexpectedly crashes. Save yourself from this nightmare with either an external device (thumb drive or hard drive), or setup cloud storage (icloud, dropbox, Google drive, etc.). Especially if you are using the lab computers. 

**Mobile device with recording capability**: We will be recording sound and video, and you can use the basic components of your mobile device for this. If you do not have a mobile device with recording capabilities, there are items available for check out with the school. 

**SJSU Library Card**: Students are required to get a [SJSU library card](https://library.sjsu.edu/borrow-renew-return/library-account) and a pin number. The card is necessary for access to [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/) tutorials and free admission to museums we will visit. When you get the card, make sure you get the pin number so that you can use the benefits.

**Arduino Rev 3:** We will be working with arduinos to create sensor based artwork. Students are required to purchase an Arduino Uno Rev3 [available here](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3) for $22. 

**Three button mouse:** A mouse with a scroll button and a right and left click button will be a great help for you. 

**Software to Download**

**Sign Up for these Programs**
<br>
* **[Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/)**:  Lynda.com is an incredible resource for software training, and it is FREE to you with your SJSU library card. In this class, you will occasionally  be referred to lynda.com for an online tutorial. These are great because you can learn at your own pace. Access to Lynda is free through the [SJSU library portal here](https://www.lynda.com/portal/patron?org=sjlibrary.org.). **You need to get a library card and pin first!**
<br>
* **[GitHub](https://github.com)**: You will need a GitHub account for your websites. Sign up with your SJSU email to get free private repositories.
<br>
* **[Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/)**: Soundcloud is a place to share and listen to sounds, music, and recordings. It is free and you will put your sound art on this site.
<br>
* **[Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/)**: Vimeo is like YouTube, with a focus on video art. It is free, but does have an upload limit. You will put your video art on this site.
