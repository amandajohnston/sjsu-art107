### Grading Rubric
**All assignments are graded considering the following criteria:** <br><br>


| A: Excellence| B: Above  Average  | C: Average  | D: Below Average  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The student fully commits to their project, both conceptually and technically. The idea is strong and it is a technically and visually strong project. The final work created not only meets the criteria but it exceeds it. The student demonstrates a full understanding of the course content, and is able to apply that understanding in making original work with their own personal style. | The student shows an understanding of the expected criteria for the assignment, and a sincere attempt to engage the conceptual framework. The quality of the project is good but not stellar. Technical understanding is demonstrated but has room for improvement.| The student demonstrates a limited understanding of the conceptual framework of the assignment, and/or technical execution is underdeveloped with issues that could have been addressed in class or during office hours. The work would improve if more time and/or attention was dedicated to the project. | The student only shows the slightest understanding of the intent of the assignment. There is a general failure to follow the intent and nuance of the assignment. The project can only be described as something that needs a great deal of work before it is considered something that is complete and meeting the requirements.   |
