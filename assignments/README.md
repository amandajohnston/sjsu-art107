# Course Assignments

**> Research Plan and Proposal: 15% of grade**<br>
This class will focus on systems of all kinds. What kind of system will you explore this semester? How will you use digital media art to make visual and/or interactive the facets of this system? What kind of sustained research do you need to complete to explore this system and gather material? Write a ~750 word one page essay (at least) describing your concept and your relationship to it. Then, on another page, outline the forms of digital media art you plan to explore and utilize in your three projects for this class. Include a timeline for completion of each project. Your overall proposal should be three pages and submitted as a PDF. <br>

**> Projects 1-3: Making Systems Visible 40% of grade (~16% each)**<br>
Based on their research and proposal, each student will complete three projects (at least) that together form a cohesive body of work. At least one of the projects is required to be in the class exhibition at the end of the semester. Students may employ a variety of applications explored in class (projection mapping, augmented reality, interactive sensors, circuit bending, etc). Or, students may employ other applications including web, sound, video, etc. Emphasis will be placed on conceptual strength of projects (not technical bells and whistles) and how well the applications chosen support the concept of the work. Requirements for specific applications will be outlined on the course website and determined in one-on-one meetings with the instructor. 

**For presentation in the class show:**
- Installations may be designed for the gallery space. 
- Performances may be scheduled for the opening night. 
- Browser-based projects may be presented on laptops. 
- Single-channel video can show either on a loop in the gallery, or in a separate class screening, TBD.

**> Documentation & Final Presentation: 20% of grade**<br>
Each student will give a 15 minute final presentation that will be an artist talk on the work they have completed in this class. Students should speak about the process that went in to making their work, including what they researched, and how they made their work. Along with presenting in class, each student should submit the following: a link to their portfolio website that includes documentation of their new projects, and a one page PDF artistic research statement that articulates in writing their honed artistic research practice. 

**> In-class Exercises & Readings: 15% of grade**<br>
There will be regular technical exercises completed in class over the course of the semester. Completion of these in-class exercises is essential to learning the skills necessary to complete the class projects. Understand these are in-class exercises. Extra work will be required to complete them outside of class, which might result in a grade deduction. 

**> Participation: 10% of grade**<br>
Participation consists of student engagement in class time- showing up to class on time, completing reading and response assignments, being active in class discussions and lectures, paying attention and speaking up in class critiques, and engaging and supporting your classmates in their projects and ideas.Â Asking questions, contributing your thoughts, contributing to group projects, and being a positive part of the class community is essential to the success of this course. This also includes full participation in installation, de-installation, and gallery hours for the class exhibition.
